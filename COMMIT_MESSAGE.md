fix: deploy json-server mock API to Vercel and connect Netlify frontend

- Create mock-backend folder with json-server for Vercel deployment
- Add identical db.json data to ensure consistency between local and deployed
- Configure Vercel deployment with proper CORS and routing
- Update environment configuration to use Vercel API URL in production
- Implement full mobile responsiveness across all components:
  * Responsive navigation with hamburger menu
  * Mobile card layouts for task and person lists
  * Adaptive form dialogs and button layouts
  * Mobile-optimized filters and pagination
- Add comprehensive Vercel deployment documentation
- Ensure all CRUD operations work identically in local and deployed environments
- Maintain assignment requirement of using mock backend (json-server)

The application now works identically on local and deployed environments
with full CRUD functionality and mobile responsiveness.

Deployment setup: Netlify (frontend) + Vercel (json-server mock API)
